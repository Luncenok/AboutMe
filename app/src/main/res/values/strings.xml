    <string name="bio">Hi, mi name is Mateusz Idziejczak.
    \n\nI love cat.
    \n\nThe kind that is alive and walks around my house\nFun fact is that I have several catuariums and also a river.
    \n\nI like eating cat, too. Raw cat. Grilled cat. Smoked cat. Poached cat - not so much.
    \nAnd sometimes I even go cating.
    \nAnd even less sometimes, I actually catch something.
    \n\nOnce, when I was camping in Canada, and very hungry, I even caught a large cat with my hands.
    \n\nI\'ll be happy to teach you how to make your own catuarium.
    \nYou should ask someone else about cating, though.\n\n</string>
